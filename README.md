# multithreadingExample

An exercise in multithreading in Java from the book *Big Java, Early Objects*.

The exercise is as follows: Write a program that searches all files specified on the command line 
and prints out all lines containing a reserved word. Start a new thread for each file.

The reserved word is args[0] and the following command line arguments (args[1], args[2],...) are text files for processing. 
The text files should be in the src folder (src is also the directory where you run the program on the command line).
